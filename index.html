        <p> Hello world! I'm Peter. I work as a project manager/agile coach/scrum master for R&D on self-driving trucks. Currently I call Portland, OR home and spend my freetime enjoying the many adventures one can experience in the Pacific Northwest</p>
        <p> This website was created as an expirment for me to learn more about web development and maybe get something close to a portfolio site out of the experimentation. The contents of this site include the following:</p>
        <p><a href="https://pshoffe.github.io/tufte-css/test">ABOUT ME</a> <em>- Finds things like my resume here</em></p>
        <p><a href="https://pshoffe.github.io/tufte-css/test">PORTFOLIO</a> <em>- Examples of my work such as data visulizations and writing</em></p>
        <p><a href="https://pshoffe.github.io/tufte-css/test">MEANDERINGS AND DIGRESSIONS</a> <em>- Something akin to a blog</em></p>

        <p>Thank you for stopping by learn more about me!</p>
        <p>This website was created using Tufte CSSTufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com">Dave Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-<span class="latex">L<span class="latex-sup">a</span>T<span class="latex-sub">e</span>X</span></a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
        <p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please note the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
